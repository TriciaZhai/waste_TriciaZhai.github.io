## What I do now
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

weekdays = head(weekdays(.leap.seconds), 7) %>% 

today = Sys.Date()
week = c(3:9) + today
day = factor( weekdays(week), levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))


for(as.numeric(day) in 1:7){
  to_do()
}
  
to_do = function(x){
  if (as.numeric(x) < 5) {
    stop("Go to classes, do homework, gym, sleep")
  } else if (as.numeric(x) == 5) {
    stop("do homework, gym, food shopping, sleep")
  }
    stop("go out play, cook, sleep")
}


vec_1 = c("do homework", "gym", "food shopping", "sleep")
vec_2 = c(rbinom(4,1, 0.6))
vec_1*vec_2
```
