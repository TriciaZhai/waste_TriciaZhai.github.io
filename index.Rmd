## What I do now
```{r plan_coming_week}
library(tidyverse)
today = Sys.Date()
week = c(0:6) + today
week_end_pool = 
  tibble(
  week_end = c("go to park", "do home work", "gym", "group study", "go to a musical","dinner party", "meal prep"))
week_day_pool = 
  tibble(
  week_day = c("do home work", "gym", "group study", "go to lecture"))


to_do = function(x)
  {
  if (weekdays(x) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"))
    {
    paste(sample_n(week_end_pool, 2), sep = ",")
    #stop("weekend, yay!")
    } 
  else{
   paste("go to class", sample_n(week_day_pool, 2), sep = ",")}
  }

output = vector("list", length = 7)
for (i in 1:7) {
  output[[i]] = to_do(week[[i]]) 
}

knitr::kable(tibble(weekdays(week), output)) 
```
